# PrettyStraightForward-Assembler
The provided code is a partial implementation of a basic assembler for translating assembly language into machine code, tailored for a simplified MIPS-like architecture. It performs tasks like parsing instructions, mapping label addresses, and generating machine code, covering key instruction formats such as R-type, I-type, and J-type. 

The assembler supports basic operations such as 
- **addition** 
- **subtraction**
- **multiplication**.

It's a straightforward implementation to demonstrate fundamental concepts of assembly languages and the translation process to machine code.

### 🚀 Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`
- Translation of assembly instructions into machine code
- Modular structure for ease of understanding and potential extension
- Easy to use and customize for educational or experimental purposes

### Getting started 
- Compile the main2.c and run the executable with with one of the provided text files in the command line argument.
