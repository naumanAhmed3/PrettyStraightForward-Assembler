# PrettyStraightForward-Assembler
The provided code is a partial implementation of a basic assembler for translating assembly language into machine code, tailored for a simplified MIPS-like architecture. It performs tasks like parsing instructions, mapping label addresses, and generating machine code, covering key instruction formats such as R-type, I-type, and J-type.
